This is the Professional Portfolio project.

This project is supposed to show what a coder's portfolio could look like. (The instructional team has advised that Personalized information is not required)






Users can utilize this site to see what possibilities exists for coder portfolios. 

Assistance can be acquired by emailing mrmiles68@yahoo.com

Once graded, this will be the final version of the project.

Contributions are no longer necessary for this project, previous contributions have be commented in the code.
